# Phase 4 Full-Stack Application Project Template

## Introduction

### Removing Existing Git Configuration


## Setup

### `server/`

The `server/` directory contains all of the backend code.

`app.py` is the Flask application.
To download the dependencies for the backend server, run:

```console
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

You can run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by
running:

```console
python server/app.py
```

### `client/`

The `client/` directory contains all of the frontend code. The file
`package.json` has been configured with common React application dependencies,
include `react-router-dom`. The file also sets the `proxy` field to forward
requests to `"http://localhost:5555". Feel free to change this to another port-
just remember to configure your Flask app to use another port as well!

To download the dependencies for the frontend client, run:

```console
npm install --prefix client
```

You can run your React app on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) by
running:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```


## Updating Your README.md

`README.md` is a Markdown file that describes your project. These files can be
used in many different ways- you may have noticed that we use them to generate
entire Canvas lessons- but they're most commonly used as homepages for online
Git repositories. **When you develop something that you want other people to
use, you need to have a README.**

Markdown is not a language that we cover in Flatiron's Software Engineering
curriculum, but it's not a particularly difficult language to learn (if you've
ever left a comment on Reddit, you might already know the basics). Refer to the
cheat sheet in this lesson's resources for a basic guide to Markdown.

### What Goes into a README?

This README should serve as a template for your own- go through the important
files in your project and describe what they do. Each file that you edit (you
can ignore your migration files) should get at least a paragraph. Each function
should get a small blurb.

You should descibe your application first, and with a good level of detail. The
rest should be ordered by importance to the user. (Probably routes next, then
models.)

Screenshots and links to resources that you used throughout are also useful to
users and collaborators, but a little more syntactically complicated. Only add
these in if you're feeling comfortable with Markdown.
